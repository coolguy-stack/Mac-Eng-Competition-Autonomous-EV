# Mac-Eng-Competition-Autonomous-EV

Participated in the annual McMaster Engineering Competition 2023, winning the third place with our autonomous Electric Vehicle project. 

Autonomous Battery Optimization
Developed and integrated real-time battery optimization system using Python's Tkinter GUI. 
Utilized the Tesla Model 3 database to optimize battery usage and run real-time simulations with upto 97% accuracy.

Autonomous Messaging System
Spearheaded the development of a text-to-speech and speech-to-text messaging system for autonomous EV's.
Utilized the Google text-to-speech API to simulate real time conversations with other users. 
Utilized the PyGame GUI for the dashboard and UI simulations.
